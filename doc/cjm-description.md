# 1. Role

You are the organizer of the tournament. You need to have a list of players, a control of the player's games and etc. 

# 2. Logging in

You go on the front page and choose the type of logging in. Your result is an access to the systems' capabilities.


# 3. Creating the chess tournament

This is your main desire and goal. You enter the settings, such as schemes-and-rounds. You then choose the name and formats. You hit enter and sitback.

# 4. Adding the players.

You now enter the player's info -- FIDE, profiles, names and other stuff. If you want your net be nice, you should enter the information thoroughly.

# 5. Net generation.

Sit back and watch. (Something wild goes inside)

# 6. Filling the results and controlling the flow 

Here is your second best chance to shine. You control the net, show who won, how and what was the party going. Who dropped, DSQed, and other stuff. The result would be one person winner. 

# 7. Receiving the standings

You now want to finalize your tournament and ~~print the standings on your wall~~ get everyone a nice overview how the tournament went!
